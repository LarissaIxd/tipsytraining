<p>Tispy Training was developed as a way to connect people. Have you ever been to a bar and heard of a cocktail but never knew what was in it? Have you ever wanted to recreate your favourite cocktail from a night out? 
<br>
<br>
Well Tispy Training is here to help you understand what is included in those delicious drinks. Tipsy Training is set of 5 illustrations which break up the ingredients of the cocktail in an attractive manner whilst aiding the consumer to simply create the same drink with ease.
<br>
<br>
Tispy Training Illustrations are currently available to download as wallpapers for you laptop, for free. Hopefully the future is bright for Tipsy Training as there will be many more Illustrations to come, and in many different forms.

    <h2 id= "bloodymaria">Bloody Maria</h2>
    <img src= "img/BloodyMaria.jpg" alt="Illustration of Bloody Maria"/>

<p>For those who like their Bloody Mary hot and spicy, this tequila-powered recipe uses Sangrita (an age-old, chilli-infused tomato juice and grenadine concoction) as its a mixer, adding a complexity of flavours and aromas - and more than a little heat.</p>
    
<p><b>Tip: </b> This is the grown-up sister of the Bloody Mary. Tequila is the perfect flavour pairing for tomatoes</p>

    <img src= "img/PinaTequila.jpg" alt="Illustration of Pina Tequila"/>

<p>The classic coconut cockatil, spiked with silver tequila and an embarrassing amount of cocktail umbrellas, plastic monkeys and curly straws. </p>

<p><b>Tip: </b> Keep it kitsch and (not very) classy. </p>

    <img src= "img/ThePerfectMargarita.jpg" alt="Illustration of The Perfect Margarita"/>

<p>If it ain't broke... Perfectly balanced, this classic cocktail must be sipped ice cold and, once your eyes uncross, you can make another. </p>

<p><b>Tip: </b> Get messy! The lime juice and salt rim should look deliciously clumpy - just how it's supposed to be. </p>

    <img src= "img/TequilaSunrise.jpg" alt="Illustration of a Tequila Sunrise"/>

<p>One sip of a Tequila Sunrise, with its novelty colour gradient from orange to bloof-red and cherry, is like time travelling back to the 1980's. Drink with big hair, frosted eye shadow and the soundtrack to Cocktail on repeat.</p>
